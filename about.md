## About blog

I've always been intrigued by the idea of being a librarian. I read and watch a lot, and I created this blog to host a collection of materials that I've manually compiled over many years. Over time, I'll add annotations to all the content.

## About me

Trying to be a good engineer. I work professionally in game development and currently taking "Computer, Enhance!" course by Casey Muratori, building a pet project based on the STM32 Blue Pill, and developing games on my own OpenGL-based engine.

# igj0 inspiration
<br>

There was a 4-day game jam that took place in 2002. Jam's theme was "100,000 Guys". 

Look at this [website](http://www.indiegamejam.com/igj0/index.html) and see what was possible on the following hardware: 

- Pentium 4 1.8GHz  
- 256MB DDR RAM  
- GeForce 4 Ti 4600 card

Here are some screenshots:

Take into account that most games have terrain, characters, UI, etc., and some of them even have multiplayer.

*Now imagine what indie devs can do today.*

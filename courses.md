Generally, I prefer books and self-education to courses, but here are a few that I enjoyed:

> "Learn the basics of Assembly 6502 and computer architecture programming games for the Nintendo Entertainment System"

[NES Programming with 6502 Assembly](https://pikuma.com/courses/nes-game-programming-tutorial)

> Handmade Hero is an ongoing project by Casey Muratori to create a complete, professional-quality game accompanied by videos that explain every single line of its source code.

[Handmade Hero](https://guide.handmadehero.org/)

> This series is designed for programmers who know how to write programs, but donâ€™t know how hardware runs those programs.
